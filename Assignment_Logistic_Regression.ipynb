        "**Answer:**  --> The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR) are conditions that must hold true for the model to produce valid, unbiased, and reliable results. These assumptions are:\n",

        "Homoscedasticity\n",
        "The variance of residuals is constant across all values of X. If the spread of errors increases or decreases with X, heteroscedasticity occurs.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** --> The method of least squares in linear regression is a technique used to estimate the best-fitting regression line for a given dataset. It works by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, where residuals are the differences between the observed values and the predicted values. Squaring the residuals ensures that positive and negative errors do not cancel each other out and gives more weight to larger errors. By finding the values of the intercept and slope that minimize this total squared error, the method produces the most accurate linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n"

        "**Answer:** --> Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used to predict binary outcomes (such as yes/no, 0/1, pass/fail) by modeling the probability of an event using the logistic (sigmoid) function. It estimates the likelihood that an observation belongs to a particular class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It differs from Linear Regression in that linear regression predicts continuous numerical values using a straight-line equation, while logistic regression predicts probabilities that are mapped to class labels. Linear regression can produce values outside the 0–1 range, whereas logistic regression restricts outputs between 0 and 1. Additionally, logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation, while linear regression uses the method of least squares."

It indicates the proportion of total variance in the outcome variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. An R-squared value closer to 1 means the model provides a better fit to the data, while a value closer to 0 indicates poor explanatory power."
