        "\n",
        "Answer:- DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define or modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, and indexes. These commands affect how data is stored rather than the data itself. DDL operations are usually auto-committed, meaning changes are saved immediately. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
        "    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
        "    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This command creates a new table named Employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manage and modify the data stored inside database tables. These commands allow users to insert, update, or delete records. Unlike DDL, DML changes can be rolled back if not committed. Common DML commands include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary)\n",
        "VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 50000);\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This command adds a new record to the Employees table.\n",
        "\n",
        "DQL (Data Query Language) commands are used to retrieve data from the database. The primary DQL command is SELECT, which allows users to fetch specific records based on conditions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:- The purpose of SQL constraints is to apply rules on table columns to maintain the correctness, reliability, and consistency of data. They prevent invalid data entry and help enforce business rules at the database level.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PRIMARY KEY Constraint\n",
        "A PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies each record in a table. It does not allow duplicate or NULL values.\n",
        "Scenario: In a Students table, the Student_ID column can be set as a PRIMARY KEY to ensure every student has a unique identification number.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. FOREIGN KEY Constraint\n",
        "A FOREIGN KEY establishes a relationship between two tables. It ensures that a value in one table matches an existing value in another table.\n",
        "Scenario: In an Orders table, the Customer_ID column can be a FOREIGN KEY referencing the Customers table. This ensures orders are placed only by existing customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. NOT NULL Constraint\n",
        "The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot store NULL (empty) values.\n",
        "Scenario: In an Employees table, the Name column can be set as NOT NULL to ensure every employee record has a name.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:- The LIMIT clause in SQL is used to specify the maximum number of records that should be returned by a query. It restricts the result set to a fixed number of rows. On the other hand, the OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return the results. It controls the starting point of the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "When used together, LIMIT and OFFSET are commonly applied for pagination. For example, if each page contains 10 records and you want to retrieve the third page of results, you first calculate how many records need to be skipped. The formula is: (Page number − 1) × Records per page. For the third page, this becomes (3 − 1) × 10 = 20. This means you must skip the first 20 records.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, you would use LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20. This skips the first 20 rows and then returns the next 10 rows, which represent the third page of results."

        "\n",
        "Answer:- A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary named result set that is defined using the WITH keyword and exists only for the duration of a single query. It allows you to create a logical, reusable subquery that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Unlike a permanent table, a CTE is not stored in the database; it is created and used only while the query runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main benefit of a CTE is improved readability. Complex queries with multiple joins or subqueries become easier to understand because the logic is separated into clear steps. Another advantage is better maintainability, as changes can be made inside the CTE without modifying the entire query. CTEs also support recursion, which is useful for hierarchical data such as organizational structures.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:- SQL Normalization is a database design technique used to structure tables in a way that minimizes data duplication and prevents anomalies during insert, update, or delete operations. The primary goals of normalization are to eliminate redundant data, ensure data dependency is logical, and improve overall consistency and efficiency of the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "First Normal Form (1NF) requires that a table contains only atomic (indivisible) values and that each column holds a single value. It also requires that each record be unique. For example, a table should not store multiple phone numbers in one column; instead, each phone number should be stored in a separate row.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second Normal Form (2NF) builds on 1NF and requires that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key. It mainly applies to tables with composite primary keys. This means partial dependency should be removed. For example, in a table with Student_ID and Course_ID as a composite key, student name should depend only on Student_ID, so it should be stored separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third Normal Form (3NF) builds on 2NF and requires that there are no transitive dependencies. Non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes. This ensures better data integrity and reduces redundancy."
