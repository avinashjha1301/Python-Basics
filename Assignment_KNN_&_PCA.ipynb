        "\n",
        " K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised, non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It works by storing the training data and making predictions based on similarity. For a new data point, KNN calculates the distance (such as Euclidean distance) between the point and all training samples, then selects the K nearest neighbors.\n",
        "In classification, the predicted class is determined by majority voting among the neighbors.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised dimensionality-reduction technique that transforms original correlated features into a smaller set of new, uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components capture the maximum variance present in the data while reducing dimensionality. PCA changes the feature space by combining features mathematically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection, in contrast, chooses a subset of the original features based on statistical tests, model importance, or domain knowledge, without transforming them.\n",

        "Answer :- In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), eigenvectors represent the directions (axes) along which the data varies the most, while eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured along each eigenvector. They are computed from the covariance matrix of the data. Eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues correspond to more important principal components. PCA selects the top eigenvectors based on the highest eigenvalues to reduce dimensionality while preserving maximum information. Thus, eigenvectors define the new feature space, and eigenvalues help decide how many principal components to keep, ensuring minimal information loss."

        "KNN is a distance-based algorithm whose performance degrades in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. PCA addresses this by reducing the number of features while preserving most of the data’s variance. By projecting data onto fewer, informative principal components, PCA removes noise, reduces sparsity, and makes distance calculations more meaningful. As a result, KNN becomes faster, more accurate, and less sensitive to irrelevant features. In practice, applying PCA before KNN improves computational efficiency and often leads to better classification or regression performance."
